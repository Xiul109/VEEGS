# VEEGS

Visual ElectroencEphaloGraphy Software (VEEGS) is an application for visualizing
EEG data. It can be seen as a GUI for the library [eeglib](https://github.com/Xiul109/eeglib). VEEGS is an intuitive software that only requieres some knowledge about EEG to be properly used.

## Installation

This app uses the GUI framework Qt5, so you need to install it first. The installation depends on your OS, so you probably can find it by googling: "qt5 'OS name'"

In Archlinux it can be installed through the next command:

`$ pacman -S qt5-base`


Once Qt5 is installed, open a terminal in the root directory and write

`$ pip install .`
